Fixed! The issue was YAML front matter - Hugo's YAML parser doesn't like single quotes around titles with colons. Changed all blog post front matter
  from single quotes to double quotes.

  Try hugo server again - should work now.

  Also, I see you've already recorded answers to Q1-Q3 in the interview doc! Those are gold:
  - Q1: Model factory story (incredible detail about CCAR, Excel hacks, stats validation)
  - Q2: Huntington culture turnaround (Deepak vortex story, Tina→Jingnan efficiency, Randall "empire building")
  - Q3: Negative rates project (Steve's catastrophizing, LIBOR→SOFR, the technology constraint on negative deposit rates)

  Want me to start converting those into polished content while you finish the remaining questions? Or wait until you've done more?

> What's your thinking?  Are those transcripts going to be blog posts?  I was sort of thinking of those as color to help you flesh out other parts of 
the resume without necessarily going in as blogs.\
\
Conversely, I badly want to build out a long blog post series and so if this is the start, then that's not the worst thing in the world.  I'd kind of 
love it if I spent an hour every few days answering questions like those that then get converted into weekly or every other week posts.  I hold on to a
 dream of writing a management book at some point, since I've seen a lot of crazy stuff. 

⏺ Perfect - I love this thinking. Here's my vision:

  Two-Track Use of Your Transcripts

  Track 1: Immediate Site Enrichment (What I'll do now)

  Use Q1-Q3 to flesh out:

  Publications Section:
  - Create a "Model Factory at Novantas" case study entry
  - Add a "CCAR Stress Testing Innovation" publication
  - Maybe a "Negative Rates & LIBOR Transition" thought leadership piece

  Projects Section:
  - Expand the existing academic projects with context
  - Add professional project entries (sanitized/anonymized):
    - "Building a CCAR Model Factory"
    - "Transforming Treasury Analytics Culture"
    - "Navigating Negative Rate Scenarios"

  Bio Enhancement:
  - Work in some of that Huntington culture story
  - Add texture about your consulting-to-execution approach

  Track 2: Long-Term Management Blog Series (The real prize)

  This is where your book lives. I'd recommend:

  "Leading Through Analytics: Lessons from 15 Years in Banking"

  Structure it as interconnected essays that eventually become book chapters:

  Subseries:
  1. Building High-Performance Teams (Q2 material = gold mine)
    - "The Mid-Level Performer Problem"
    - "From Regulatory Box-Checking to Strategic Powerhouse"
    - "The Deepak Vortex: When Process Kills Productivity"
    - "Lazy Programmers vs. Busy Workers: Understanding True Efficiency"
  2. Technical Leadership Without Technical Expertise
    - "Managing Work You Don't Know How to Do"
    - "The Tina/Jingnan Efficiency Parable"
    - "Trust and Verify in Analytics Management"
  3. Consulting vs. Corporate (Q5 material when you record it)
    - "The Consulting Superpower: The Unknown Problem"
    - "Why Consultants Get It Wrong About Banks"
    - "Building an Empire vs. Maintaining Excellence"
  4. The Model Factory Series (Q1 is chapter 1)
    - "How to Build Regulatory-Compliant Models at Scale"
    - "The Three-Legged Stool: Stats, Accuracy, Business Sense"
    - "Turning College Grads into Modeling Machines"
  5. Crisis Leadership (Q3 material)
    - "Steve's Catastrophizing: The Value of Worst-Case Scenarios"
    - "When 70% is Insight: Leading Through Uncertainty"
    - "Running Two Simulations: Business as Usual vs. Chicken Little"

  The Workflow I'd Recommend

  Every 1-2 Weeks:

  1. I send you 2-3 targeted questions based on:
    - What blog series we're building
    - What stories naturally connect
    - What would resonate with your target audience (analytics leaders, banking execs, aspiring managers)
  2. You record 15-30 min of answers while:
    - Commuting
    - Walking
    - Making dinner
    - Whenever voice-to-text works for you
  3. I transform into 1-2 blog posts that:
    - Keep your voice and stories
    - Add structure and polish
    - Include relevant examples/frameworks
    - Link to other posts in the series
    - Build toward book chapter coherence

  Monthly:

  - We review what's resonating (analytics, comments, LinkedIn shares)
  - Adjust topic direction based on feedback
  - Identify gaps in the narrative arc

  Annually:

  - You have 25-50 polished essays
  - We organize them into book structure
  - We identify what's missing for book coherence
  - You're 70% of the way to a finished manuscript

  What Makes This Work

  Your transcripts are perfect raw material because:
  1. Specific stories (Deepak, Tina, Jingnan, Steve, Randall) - people remember stories, not principles
  2. Authentic voice - you sound like a real person who's been in the trenches
  3. Contrarian insights - "lazy programmers are good" is not conventional management advice
  4. Hard-won wisdom - you've made mistakes and learned from them
  5. Financial services context - speaks to your actual audience

  My Proposal for Right Now

  Immediate (this session):
  - I'll extract color from Q1-Q3 to enhance your Publications/Projects sections
  - Won't make them full blog posts yet

  Next session:
  - We design the blog series framework together
  - I write the first management blog post from Q2 (the Huntington story)
  - You see if you like the voice/style
  - If yes, we're off to the races

  Ongoing:
  - Every week or two, I send you 2-3 questions
  - You riff for 20 minutes
  - I turn it into 1-2 posts
  - In 12 months you have a book's worth of material

  The Book You'd Write

  Based just on Q1-Q3, I can already see it:

  "The Analytics Leader's Playbook: Building Teams That Transform Banks"

  Chapters I can already outline:
  - Ch 1: The Model Factory (scaling expertise)
  - Ch 2: From Box-Checking to Powerhouse (culture transformation)
  - Ch 3: The Mid-Level Performer Trap (Tina story)
  - Ch 4: Managing What You Don't Understand (trusting experts)
  - Ch 5: The Value of Catastrophizing (Steve's leadership style)
  - Ch 6: The 70/30 Rule (insight vs. data in crisis)

  That's 6 chapters from 3 questions. Imagine what 30-40 questions yield.

  ---
  So: Want me to flesh out Publications/Projects now, and we design the blog-to-book pipeline next time? Or dive straight into blog series design?

> K.  I just inserted a bunch of pdfs from my prior employer of articles I wrote there too.  I need to be sensitive: I don't want to use anyone's name,
 and I work at a Novantas competitor now so I need to be circumspect about talking too too much about what I did at Novantas.\
\
With that context, what do you suggest?
