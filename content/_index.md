Chief Analytics Officer at [Nomis Solutions](https://nomissolutions.com/), bringing 15+ years of experience in banking analytics, deposit pricing, and stress testing to fintech innovation.

From leading pricing optimization for major US banks at Novantas (now Curinos) to managing $200B balance sheets at Huntington Bank, I bridge the gap between cutting-edge analytics and practical business impact. My "model factory" approach to CCAR forecasting now powers >10% of US retail bank deposits.

Recent MS in Data Science (AI specialization) from Northwestern complements deep expertise in financial modeling, regulatory analytics, and team building. Passionate about pragmatic AI implementation that augments—not replaces—human judgment in banking.

When I'm not optimizing deposit betas or building recommendation engines, you'll find me experimenting in the kitchen or exploring the Pacific Northwest with my family.
