As banks struggle to manage hundreds of models requiring increasing resources, this article proposes using sophisticated technology, including machine learning, to automate the model management process.

**The Challenge:**
A bank with 150 models can have more than 600 model monitoring runs a year, with volumes expected to increase 3-5x due to:
- Moving from annual to quarterly (or monthly) refreshes (3-4x)
- Adding new models (e.g., CECL/IFRS 9 models)

**Three Dimensions of Technology Solutions:**
1. **Data:** High-performance data management with automated validation
2. **Modeling:** Machine learning to generate candidate models within constraints
3. **Monitoring:** Automated integration of models into monitoring frameworks

**Result:** Higher quality outcomes, lower maintenance costs, and happier model management teams.
