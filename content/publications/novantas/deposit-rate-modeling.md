PPNR and ALM modeling teams know that the bar for deposit rate modeling has risen. This article explains the Novantas regression-based approach and compares its performance to beta and replicating portfolio techniques.

**Comparison of Approaches:**

**Traditional Betas:**
- Easy to communicate
- Limited by linearity, reliance on key judgments
- MAPE: ~60% in testing

**Replicating Portfolios:**
- Wide range of applications (duration, FTP, hedging)
- Constraints can limit predictive accuracy
- Optimized for minimizing spread variance

**Novantas Regression Approach:**
- Creates 100,000+ econometric models from all yield curve combinations
- Rigorous statistical culling and prioritization
- Superior predictive power (MAPE: ~15% in testing)
- Ensures statistical significance of all drivers
- No need to presuppose index rates or define rate bands ex ante

**Result:** More accurate deposit rate forecasts across full range of economic scenarios, suitable for both PPNR stress testing and ALM applications.
