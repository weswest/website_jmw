One of the most common transformations of the dependent variable in PPNR Stress Testing is to predict growth in balances, revenue, and expenses from period to period. This article outlines why the preferred transformation is a logarithmic one (diff-log or Δln), as opposed to percentage change (Δ%).

**Key Topics:**
- Conceptual rationale for Δln: Similar ease of interpretation with additional benefits
- Benefits of Δln models: No negative balances, symmetry of results
- Mathematical proof: Why Δln works and Δ% does not for eliminating unit root
- Practical implementation considerations
