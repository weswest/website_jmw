**Co-authors:** Ryan Schulz, Steve Turner

For banks in many countries the current model development and validation process is broken: it takes too long, there are too many nonstandard elements, there is too much rework, and it introduces material risk when critical models fail validation.

**The Solution:**
Validation should take on separate roles at the front and back of the development process - establishing a new engineering role along with its current quality control responsibilities.

**Key Benefits:**
- Streamlining the validation process
- Accelerating the development timeline
- Reducing failure risk through upfront specification of acceptance criteria
- Eliminating costly restarts due to "incorrect" early decisions
