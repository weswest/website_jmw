With 2016 CCAR submitted and the cycle shortened from 15 to 12 months, this article highlights the eight most critical immediate steps toward a successful 2017 submission, including:

1. Lock down your 2017 CCAR calendar now (30% less time for planning and model development)
2. Kick out the consultants (build sustainable processes)
3. Plan refinements to model development and model validation in lockstep
4. Expect more weird (negative rate) scenarios
5. Use PPNR models beyond CCAR
6. Devise a consistent approach to non-modeled estimations
7. Create a robust benchmarking process
8. Avoid getting bitten by non-regulatory variables
