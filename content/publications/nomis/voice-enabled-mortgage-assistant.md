Sometimes the most valuable projects are the ones you don't pursue. Our team built a voice-enabled mortgage application system in just four hours, then decided not to take it to production. The lessons about compound AI systems proved more valuable than the prototype.

**Key Topics:**
- Building compound AI systems by orchestrating specialized tools
- Technical architecture: Whisper, GPT-3.5, voice activity detection, and text-to-speech
- Five critical engineering decisions for natural conversation interfaces
- Why we didn't ship: customization, voice quality, error handling, and integration challenges
- The power of orchestration over monolithic AI systems
- Applications of compound AI in banking: document processing, portfolio modeling, customer analytics
- Knowing when to prototype, learn, and move on
